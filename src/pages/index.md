    Sale Brass is a 4th section brass band based in Cheshire. We pride ourselves
    on being a very friendly and entertaining band and have a very active social
    side. We practise at the Claremont Centre in Sale on a Monday and Thursday
    evening between 8.00pm and 10.00pm. If you are new to the area and are
    interested in joining the band please send us a message!. Feel free to get
    in touch no matter what you play!


    If you donâ€™t have your own instrument, you are welcome to apply as we have
    many spare. We also have a thriving training band if you wish to learn an
    instrument.
